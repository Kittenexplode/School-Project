    staff, and often, parents of a public or private school have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school
    library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and

      marigolds in these gardens. These flowers make my school look even more beautiful.</p>

                  canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of
                  the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right
                  nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen
                  Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may
                  have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,
                  making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

                Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the
                school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages.
                This helps schools keep a record of the students absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this
                is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify
                which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their
                curriculums subjects. As soon as you enter a students Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes,
                number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud
                capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans
